          <h2>Where's Darby?</h2>
            <p> Michelle left to go to Singapore on Friday morning while Darby Bex and me headed to Gili Trawangan. I was the only one left coughing up a lung and with no voice. We took another fast boat over to Gili T which was about two hours long and the boat rocking over the bumps put us right to sleep, so we were there when we woke up. The beaches weren't as pretty as in Nusa Lembongan, but they were still beautiful. There was a view of Lombok where the earthquake took place a few days prior. We walked from the boat to our hostel which was about a five minute walk. But nonetheless a very traumatizing one. The island does not permit cars, so their mode of trasportation was by attaching a wagon to a horse. The poor horses were so skinny you could see their ribs and they were whipping them. Not cool. When we finally made it to the Gili Castle, which was the hostel we were staying in, we dropped our bags and went to eat dinner. During dinner there was a guy singing live music and he sang Country Roads to us which was our song of the trip. On our walk home we passed a bar with attractive guys so we decided to stop and play Jenga there. We didn't talk to them, but they later showed up to our hostel since the island was so small that's where people would go before going out. There was a pong tournament taking place and everybody was socializing and having fun. Eventually we talked to the guys that were at the previous bar and we told them about how while we were in Seminyak there was a bouncer with a really big gun that was pointing at Darby's foot. Remember the crazy story I said was relevant in Gili T? Well this is it. One of the guys responded to my comment and said "Well he survived the mass shooting in New Zealand last week". My jaw dropped immediately. The guys name was Joe and he didn't seem like he wanted that to be super public information, but nonetheless it was crazy to hear that. We all ended up hanging out together the rest of the night and going out together. Joe offered to put me on his shoulders at one of the clubs we were at and I said okay because I thought it would be for a couple of seconds. To my surprise it was not. He did not put me down for five minutes. Very scary. Eventually Darby ran away and Bex went home and I lost the guys so I decided to walk back as well. Two buildings away from the club I just left I hear somebody scream "hey you" and I turned around out of instinct. My mom told me not to walk home alone and not to talk to strangers in an unsafe setting. While fearing for my life I proceeded to introduce myself. We sat outside for three hours talking about life and getting to know eachother. We then said bye. This experience was different than the rest though. I didn't get his social media, which sounds like a milenial problem but it was very weird. I still regret it because this means that this awesome person I spent hours talking to I will probably never see again and I don't even have a way of getting in contact with him.

            <h2>Lights Out</h2>
            
            <p>
              Saturday morning Darby was still missing and she had prebooked a scuba diving lesson. She did not have a phone since she broke it so we had no way of contacting her. I waited with Bex while she was getting dressed in the scuba diving gear. Darby showed up out of thin air three minutes before the boat left, so they luckily dressed her and she was able to make it. I spent the next three hours studying for my Physics midterm until they returned and we went to play Jenga. While we were playing Jenga I saw Ireland walk by so I got very excited and said hi. Afterwards Darby Bex and I went to get massages which were the absolute best way to end the trip. We were then ready to take on the night. We got dressed up and went to play Jenga with Joe and his friends. Side note about Joe, when I got back from Bali I was looking through the videos I recorded while there and the first video I have at Old Man's he is in. I remembered annoying a stranger when I first walked in, but I did not know it was him. Anyways, we hung out with them until around eleven and then they went swimming while we went to Sama Same. This was quite the nightmare end to a trip because when the power went out due to the monsoon I lost Bex and Darby. Neither of them had phones and after not being able to find them for ten minutes I decided to leave. I walked home alone in the pouring rain alone and all the street lights were out and I was still coughing up a lung. The next morning I said bye to Bex and Darby. The best week of my life unfortunately came to an end. My flight home was really depressing because I did not want to leave. Although I had an unknown illness while there that got even worse when I came home, it was all worth it. I'm already planning the next adventure so stay tuned!
