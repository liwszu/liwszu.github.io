    <h2>Day One in Canggu</h2>
      <p>Our Indonesia trip started in Canggu we stayed at a hostel called Lay Day, where we rented four beds in a six bed bunker. From when we first stepped foot into the hostel we were warmly welcomed by the workers at front desk- which was poolside at the bar. They offered us Bintangs on the house and helped us get settled into our room. We then went back outside to sit by the pool and meet people from all over the world- crazy stories to come! Once it started getting dark out we all got ready for our night out and followed the others to a bar called Old Man's which is located right next to the beach. Once we started dancing here we couldn't stop.. we even ended up on a small stage they had set up and soon we had a crowd join us up there.. which did not last long considering the guys started jumping on it leaving us with ten more minutes of fun until it snapped. We decided that was a sign for us to move to the beach party they had going on right next to it. There was a dj setup on the sand and everybody was just dancing and having the time of their lives. At around three in the morning we decided it was time for us to head home, so we ordered GoJeks which are the Ubers of Indonesia. The only problem was that the area we were in was considered a red zone which means that the public transportation is controlled by the mafia and they don't technically allow GoJeks to run there. But that doesn't mean that we couldn't persuade a driver to come pick us up as we did. He told us it would be about ten minutes before he could be able to come so we sat on the side of the road and patiently waited. Right before we were picked up we saw a guy drive his moped about ten feet away from Old Mans before falling off the bike and onto the concrete- this will be relevant in the Ubud part of the story- we felt bad for him but our GoJek was here and we couldn't do much to help him anyway. When we got to the hostel we all passed out. </p>

    <h2>This Ones for the Goat</h2>
            
    <p>   The next morning we woke up super early not to waste any time and went to a coffee shop that was closer to the beach. I ordered a coffee and eggs with a side of fruit which were absolutely amazing, but I was sad to discover that they did not have ketchup. Problem one of two with Indonesia: it is very difficult to find ketchup anywhere!!! While eating breakfast we met some people who live in Canggu and work remotely... and that was the moment I found my life calling! When we finished eating and received the bill, we were all in shock. Four breakfasts and coffees cost twelve US dollars! We paid and left very happy ready to go to the beach to take surfing lessons. On our way to the beach we all bought sun glasses and keychains which came up to cost nine dollars total after some bargaining. We were in awe when we walked onto the beach and saw how pretty it was.. and when we saw somebody we met at Old Mans the night before. Turns out he lost his moped and couldn't find it- Dougie if you're reading this we hope you found your bike! He sat with us for a little while and we met some more friends that we learned were staying in our hostel. In the middle of our conversation we saw that there was a lot of noise coming from our right side so we all looked over very confused. We were very surprised and sad when we saw that there was a religious tradition taking place next to us. They had a goat tied up with aweight attached at the ankles which they proceeded to put onto a surfboard and paddle out into the middle of the ocean where people were surfing and they sacrificed it to the god of the ocean. We didn't say anything because it is their religion, but we were very unhappy and disturbed to say the least- they also do this with cows, dogs, chickens and pigs ): the poor innocent animals. After witnessing that we quickly decided to leave and not surf. When we came back to the hostel we saw somebodies stuff on one of the beds, but we didn't think much of it.. We went out to a restaurant called Moana and we had a feast of different types of fish and meat for under five dollars each. Once we were done eating it was pouring rain so we decided to call it an early night, until we were awoken at 2 am when our roommate came home and started making moaning noises, whispering ow and yelling at himself in the mirror. None of us knew that the others were awake nor did we know what was going on. We all personally decided to just stay quiet and hope that we survive the night. </p>

    <h2>Leprechaun Adventures</h2>

    <p> The next morning we asked him if he took drugs and if he was okay. He had no idea what we were talking about and said the only thing he remembers is crashing his moped the night before and being intoxicated. This only connected the dots of why he was saying ow, but we let it go. We were planning on leaving Canggu that day, but after talking to our roommate- whose name is Shane- he convinced us to stay another night and celebrate Saint Patricks day with him since he was Irish. We all went to breakfast at this outdoor garage breakfast spot which had a DJ and delicious food AND KETCHUP! Shane told us his life story and we all ended up loving him and adopting him and renaming him as our leprechaun. After breakfast we hung out by the pool with our leprechaun and spent the day meeting more people staying there. They were all from different parts of the world and for some reason three of them decided to tell us their names were Craig, so we had a running joke throughout the trip that we would name people Craig- relevant in Nusa Lembongan. After spending the day with all the Craigs we needed to eat so we went to a black sand beach where we saw a beautiful sunset, but then it started monsooning while we were eating so they closed the drapes since almost everything is outdoors. By the time we were done eating the streets were flooding and we were in a red zone so we could not catch a GoJek. Bex drove Michelle back on her moped while Darby and I walked back. Left unsupervised we are not the smartest pair, so we decided to hop onto a locals bike and let him drive us home. Those five minutes were the scariest of my life. He was screaming as a joke the entire drive and then kissed Dary on the cheek without her knowing. Luckily we made it back to Lay Day alive and even had a surprise waiting for us! We had a new roommate named Axel! He was warned about our leprechaun and very surprised when he saw him and he was six feet tall. We all enjoyed our last night with everybody staying there and made even more friends. Our leprechaun introduced us to another new comer named Ollie who will be relevant in the Ubud section. Later everybody went to Old Mans again, but we came home since we had an early boat the next morning. </p>
