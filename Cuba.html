    <p>A day in Havanna. Known for the beautiful colors and old cars. American travel to Cuba has been banned for quite a while and recently became possible again. Cuba is also infamous for their cigars, with a local having set the record of longest rolled cigar in the world. Although Cuba is beautiful, there is also a lot of wide spread poverty and unfortunately many stray animals.</p>
