          <h2>Alexa Play Pool</h2>
            <p> Monday morning Michelle and I woke up before everybody else. We were upset not to see leprechaun in his bed, and even more disappointed when we came back from breakfast and he was still missing. We danced around the room singing and dancing the Cotton Eye Joe when driver arrived to take us to the fast boat and we knew we only had one option left.. so we left our social media with Axel. When we were boarding the fast boat we all received Instagram dms from him saying sorry for not being there to say bye and that he hopes we stay in touch. Our hearts were filled with joy. The boat ride over to Nusa Lembongan was about a half hour long. By the time we got to the hostel our group of four had a falling out and Bex embarked on her own adventures while Michelle Darby and I went to a local beach club. During our walk over it started to monsoon and did not stop until about two hours later, so then the workers ordered us a shuttle to a sports pub. In the shuttle over we began talking to the other person in the shuttle and convincing her to come adventure with us. We all had a lot of fun on the way over and she promised to bring us to work with her if we ever visited her in California- she works on set of Jane the Virgin and Fuller House.. and she dated one of the main characters from Fuller House! Alexa was my pool partner for most of the night until we met two guys who we named Craig and Craig. They were locals who moved to Nusa Lembongan so they were telling us all about the island. Around ten pm one of the Craigs said goodnight to us so we had assumed he left. It was to our surprise that while we were leaving there was still live music playing and we heard the singer say "Craig". At that moment every single one of our necks snapped and we realized that Craig was singing. This man looked like he was about fifty years old, had a grey pony tail, nothing significant about him stuck out to us. Until we heard his voice. It was absolutely beautiful and an amazing end to the night. We all crashed at around eleven pm since we had to catch a boat back to Bali the next morning. </p>
