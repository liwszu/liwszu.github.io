          <h2>Monkeying Around</h2>
            
            <p>
            Tuesday morning problems were still not resolved, so Michelle Darby and I left the island and went to Ubud while Bex continued her stay in Nusa Lembongan. While waiting for the boat we absorbed our last moments on the beach before changing locations to Ubud which is land locked. The fast boat that transported us was sketchy to say the least. They put our bags on the top of the boat which could very easily fall off and on top of that the sections under the chairs that were supposed to hold life jackets did not have life jackets. Luckily we made it to Bali alive and were able to find a cab to take us to Ubud. During the car ride I was finally able to facetime my parents who I missed like crazy. They informed me that there was an earthquake on Lombok which is the island we were supposed to got to instead of Nusa Lembongan. I also had a nice lecture from my mom about not taking any vaccines before my trip- which reminds me I forgot to mention I got extremely sick on my second day in Bali and my voice sounded like the lady from the smoking commercials. Despite my lecture, I was still very happy to be able to talk to my parents. After hanging up the driver informed us that the three empty beers in the backseat were his breakfast. Very concerning, but yet again we thankfully made it to Ubud safely. We checked into Puri Garden Hostel and immediately fell in love. There was a big pool with a quote above it that said when you have the option of choosing between being right and being nice always choose nice. In addition to the beautiful pool, they had hammocks set up on the lawn and bean bags everywhere and morning yoga. It was our heaven. We were right in the city center, so we went on an adventure around.  </p>
            <p>
              While walking around we saw monkeys on the street and realized we must be close to the monkey sanctuary so we headed there before it closed. From the moment you enter there are monkeys everywhere. The sign when you enter emphasizes not to run and not to look them in the eyes because they see it as being agressive. About two minutes after walking in we saw people screaming and running from the monkeys since they do jump on humans. We all made comments about it wondering why they would do that and thought it would be fun to instagram live stream our adventures through the sanctuary. To our lovely surprise the second I started the live stream a monkey tried to jump on me and then chased me across a bridge and finally stopped when I crossed. While Michelle and Darby were laughing at me a monkey jumps on Michelle and starts pulling on her bar piercing. I am stuck on the other side of the bridge still live streaming. Michelle continued to scream and the monkey finally climbed off of her, but this was a very traumatic experience for all of us. The rest of the time there we were all very alert and concluded that we should leave a half hour later. We ate a yummy dinner and then went back to the hostel to sit on the hammocks. There were people sitting outside so we made new friends with two super cool guys. One was from Holland whom we named protrator and then renamed the magician. His first name originated from his calculated attempts to shoot balls while playing water pong- they turned out to not follow his calculations. We later renamed him to the magician because he tried to flirt with me by showing me card tricks. It was very entertaining. The other guy we named Ireland since yes you guessed it, he was from Ireland. Weirdly enough his name was Sean which is very similar to Shane aka our leprechaun. We actually told Ireland about our leprechaun and somehow discovered that Ireland knew Ollie. Ollie is the one that the leprechaun introduced us to at Lay Day. This lead to a conversation about Canggu and the magician mentioned being there during the same time we were. Remember how I said in Canggu we saw somebody fall off of their bike by Old Mans. Yup, you guessed it. It was the magician. All the connections we were making with these people made our hearts warm and made us feel at home. We spent the rest of the night playing card games with the magician, Ireland and some other travelers we met.

            <h2>We Love Putu</h2>
            
            <p>
            Wednesday morning we woke up for seven am yoga. Although this sounds like a very zen way of starting the morning, it was not. I spent the first ten minutes coughing and went back to the room. Afterwards Michelle Darby and I had a delicious breakfast and hired a driver named Putu to take us around Ubud. We started with Tukad Cepung which was a waterfall that was reccomended to us by a girl we met in Nusa Lembongan. The walk down was scary since the steps were tall and there were no handrails. We finally made it down to the bottom which was a combination of water and random piles of dirt, so we were walking through the water and trying not to drop anything. We heard the waterfall while we were approaching. Twenty feet from the waterfall we had to squeeze between a large rock that blocked off the entrance, which was problematic because if somebody were large then they would not fit. After we walked through we were beyond underwhelmed by the waterfall, we took a couple pictures and left. The next part was super fun. Hiking up all of the steps we had to climb down. I am going to cap that topic off with this. I do not reccomend it. We complained to Putu as we drove to our next location which was a rise terrace where they made coffee out of cat poop. There were Luwaks there in cages sleeping since they are nocturnal. Our guide there explained to us that the way they make the coffee is that the cats eat the beans with the shell still around the coffee bean and once they poop it out they peel the bean and make coffee. Although this did sound very promising we decided against drinking that coffee and had a normal tea and coffee tasting. We sipped our coffees while patiently waiting our turn on the Bali swing. I thought I was going to be deadly afraid once I was on it, but it turned out to be very relaxing and fun. We decided it was time to call it a day after the swings since there was a barbecue at Puri Garden. The rest of the night was pretty relaxed before our adventures the next day.

            <h2>Kent</h2>
            
            <p>
            Two am Thursday morning our alarms went off. It was time to put our sneakers on and catch our shuttle. Very grumpy and tired we hopped onto the shuttle and picked up two more passengers and then reached our first stop. Breakfast number one. They had delicious banana pancakes and of course coffee because we would not survive otherwise. Then it was back on the shuttle and an hour drive to our destination. When we arrived around four am they handed each of us a paper container with our second breakfast. A hard boiled egg, untoasted toast and an unripe banana. YUM! Our tour guide collected them and put them in his backpack and then it was time for us to start our adventure. A sunrise hike up Mount Batur. The first forty five minutes of the hike we were all high spirits and ready to make it to the summit. Then at around minute forty six reality hit us. We were all dripping sweating and gasping for air. We played music for about five minutes until the guys that were in our group told us to turn it off and condescendingly asked if we knew where Hungary was. It did not make the rest of the hike pleasant. We took a couple of breaks on the way up but had to keep going so we wouldn't miss the sunrise. Despite having flashlights to light up the path, it was difficult to see and pretty scary. We stumbled a couple of times to then realize we were on the edge. The sky started becoming a little light when we finally made it up. We all sat in our rain jackets shouting "Kent" and waiting for the sunrise. Kent is our friend from New York who was in Bali for spring break as well with his fraternity brothers. They eventually found us and we were beyond thrilled since the sunrise had let us down. It was too cloudy to see the entire sky, so we only saw a small bit of the sunrise. To top off this disappointment, we discovered that there were monkeys at the summit. They quickly without fear approached us and stole our breakfast. On the bright side they opened the backpack of the guys who were in our group and took their breakfast as well. They weren't the best group members, they cut our adventure short because they were grumpy and wanted to go home. Luckily we made it back to Puri Garden to say bye to the magician and Ireland. The magician worked for linkedIn, so instead of asking him for his social media we decided to stay in contact through linkedIn. The goodbyes were tough, but we had another adventure ahead.
